## Overview

I built a network-driven growth system across multiple Instagram accounts to accelerate reach and traffic to the main brand account.

## What I Delivered

I used remix loops, repost networks, collabs, backup accounts and staggered posting to create cross-account discovery. I tested different content variations, metadata, and traffic flows.

## Impact

The network grew organically from zero to ~10k followers, increasing top-of-funnel reach at low cost.
