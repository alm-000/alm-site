## Overview

I built Dansu from scratch as a physical consumer brand with full ownership of product, design, operations, growth and automation. I developed the product line, designed the brand, built the site, ran paid and organic acquisition, and set up the operational and technical systems that took the business to £30k MRR.

## What I Delivered

I sourced manufacturers, managed sampling cycles, built margin models, designed packaging, handled logistics and set up fulfilment. I built the site from the ground up, wrote the creative, ran paid media, set up influencer growth loops, and automated every major operational process.

## Impact

Dansu became a profitable, fast-moving DTC brand with a system behind it that operated with minimal manual input.
