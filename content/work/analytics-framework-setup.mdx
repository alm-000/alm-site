## Overview

I built the analytics framework for onboarding and payments, giving Exinity clear insight into user behaviour and funnel performance.

## What I Delivered

I defined tracking requirements, set up event structures, worked with engineers to implement them and created dashboards that exposed drop-offs, conversion drivers and payment success rates. This became the backbone for ongoing optimisation.

## Impact

Teams gained reliable data for decision-making, enabling faster iteration and evidence-based prioritisation of product improvements.
