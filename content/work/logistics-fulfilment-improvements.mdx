## Overview

I optimised the logistics and fulfilment flows used to process orders and authenticate products.

I analysed the full operational pipeline, identified bottlenecks in authentication and shipping, and redesigned internal tooling and workflows. I also improved communication during order progress and delays.

## Impact

Fulfilment rates increased and customer service tickets dropped by roughly 40 percent.
