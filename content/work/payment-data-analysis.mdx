## Overview

I analysed large-scale payment datasets for major financial institutions to uncover patterns in usage, activation, attrition and customer behaviour. The goal was to identify what drove strong engagement, where friction appeared in the lifecycle and which product levers had the highest impact on retention.

## What I Delivered

I worked with millions of rows of transaction and lifecycle data, building a clear picture of how customers adopted and used their cards. This included segmentation, activation funnel analysis, dormant-user behaviour, and spend distribution across channels and geographies.

## Impact

The insights informed product roadmap decisions, shaped activation and re-engagement campaigns, and helped reduce early attrition. Teams gained a clearer understanding of customer behaviour and had a data-driven strategy for improving payment usage across markets.
