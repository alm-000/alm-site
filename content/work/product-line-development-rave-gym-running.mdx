## Overview

I developed the full Dansu product line across rave, gym and running segments, taking each item from idea through to production-ready specification.

## What I Delivered

I selected materials, built technical specs, tested GSM and weave patterns, ran prototype cycles, defined sizing, created packaging formats and set pricing models. I coordinated supply chain timelines and built the commercial roadmap for new drops.

## Impact

Dansu moved from a single-product start to a structured, multi-line range with clear positioning in multiple verticals.
