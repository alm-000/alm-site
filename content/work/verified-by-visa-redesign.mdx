## Overview

I worked with Visa to redesign the Verified by Visa (VBV 2.0) authentication experience, focusing on reducing friction for customers while keeping full compliance with global security standards. The goal was to rebuild the 3-D Secure flow so it was faster, clearer and more consistent across issuing banks.

## What I Delivered

I co-led the UX redesign across the full authentication journey, from challenge screens to step-up flows. I mapped the existing experience across multiple issuers, identified failure points and analysed where users were abandoning transactions.

## Impact

The updated VBV 2.0 flow reduced drop-offs, improved successful authentication rates and created a more predictable experience for cardholders. Issuers adopted the new standards and used the updated templates to roll out more consistent journeys.
