## Overview

I built analytics dashboards for DTC stores to surface real-time insights around stock, revenue, margins and funnel performance.

## What I Delivered

Dashboards included contribution margin, cohort data, product performance, spend vs revenue, stock forecasting and retention behaviour. I defined metrics, wrote the data models and linked everything to Shopify’s API.

## Impact

Stores gained accurate, actionable data and clearer visibility into when to scale spend or reorder stock.
