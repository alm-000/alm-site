This project was about building an **experiment engine** rather than chasing isolated wins.

Key pieces included:

- A simple framework for testing offers, creatives, and funnels across paid and lifecycle.
- Clear definitions of success that tied back to cohort-level retention and LTV, not just front-end metrics.
- A weekly operating rhythm where the team reviewed results, decided what to keep, kill, or scale, and set up the next round of tests.

Instead of experimentation living only in performance marketing, it became a **shared system** that connected product, marketing, and lifecycle decisions.
