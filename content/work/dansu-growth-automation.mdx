Dansu is a towel brand where the focus was on building **repeatable growth systems** rather than one-off campaigns.

The work included:

- Designing a growth engine across paid, lifecycle, and onsite experiences.
- Instrumenting the funnel so we could see where attention and margin were leaking.
- Turning ad hoc workflows into simple operating rhythms the team could run every week.

Automation removed a lot of the manual coordination and reporting, so more time could be spent on creative work and product. The end result was a setup where **shipping every week** felt natural instead of stressful.
