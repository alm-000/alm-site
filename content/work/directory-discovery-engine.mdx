## Overview

I built a system that categorises and enriches URLs to support lead generation, outreach and scraping workflows.

## What I Delivered

The engine identified website type, extracted metadata, filtered irrelevant URLs and stored structured information. It was designed to plug into larger enrichment and scoring systems.

## Impact

It became the foundation for automated discovery across niches like festivals, venues and retailers.
