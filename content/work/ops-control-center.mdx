This project pulled **disconnected KPIs and reports** into a single operations control center for a growing e-commerce brand.

The goal was to:

- Give leadership an at-a-glance view of performance and risk.
- Replace time-consuming manual reporting with a weekly rhythm.
- Make it easier to spot problems before they became fires.

We mapped the questions leadership actually asked every week, then designed a dashboard and operating cadence around those questions instead of tools. The result was a **single source of truth** that reduced time in spreadsheets and made decisions faster.
