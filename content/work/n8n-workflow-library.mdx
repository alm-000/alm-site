For this project, the focus was **automation as leverage** for a small DTC team.

We started by:

- Mapping recurring workflows across CX, finance, and operations.
- Identifying the boring, error-prone tasks that burned time every week.

From there, we built a library of **n8n workflows** that handled data syncs, notifications, and reporting. Everything was documented in plain language so non-technical teammates could understand and adjust flows without needing an engineer in the loop.

The outcome was a set of automations that quietly removed dozens of hours of manual work per month while making processes more reliable.
