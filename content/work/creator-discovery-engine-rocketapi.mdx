## Overview

I built a system that scraped and scored Instagram creators to find high-potential partners and high-performing reels.

## What I Delivered

Using RocketAPI, I built custom scripts that pulled reel data, analysed engagement velocity, scored creators and enriched profiles with metadata. The results synced into a live dashboard and CRM for outreach.

## Impact

Creator sourcing became fully automated, and outreach shifted from manual guesswork to data-led prioritisation.
