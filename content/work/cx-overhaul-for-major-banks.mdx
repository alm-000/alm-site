## Overview

I worked with several major UK banks to review and improve their customer experience across onboarding, servicing and day-to-day digital journeys. The objective was to understand where customers were dropping off, why common tasks created friction, and how banks could simplify their core user flows.

## What I Delivered

I mapped every critical journey across web and mobile, including account opening, feature activation, payments, card management and support. Each journey was benchmarked against industry best practice, regulatory expectations and behavioural patterns from analytics and customer research.

## Impact

Banks used these findings to streamline onboarding, reduce servicing effort, and cut customer queries related to navigation and feature discovery. The work directly influenced roadmap decisions and helped teams ship cleaner, more predictable digital experiences.
