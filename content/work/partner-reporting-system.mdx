## Overview

I built a complete reporting pipeline for partner employers, giving them unified visibility into uptake, performance and repayment trends.

## What I Delivered

I worked across product, data and engineering to define metrics, structure the reporting model, and build dashboards that surfaced usage, loan status and payroll integration behaviour. I wrote the data requirements end to end and shaped how information was presented to employers.

## Impact

Partners received reliable insights for the first time, reducing support requests and improving relationship management with key employers.
