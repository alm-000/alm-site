## Overview

I contributed to Laced’s migration toward a microservices-based architecture, improving scalability and system reliability.

## What I Delivered

I defined requirements for several services, helped untangle legacy logic, and shaped the new pathways for pricing, orders and authentication. I worked closely with engineering to translate complex flows into modular, service-driven components.

## Impact

The platform became more stable, easier to scale and better equipped for new feature development.
