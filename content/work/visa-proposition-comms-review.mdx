## Overview

Visa hired our team to review how their card products were positioned across digital channels. The brief was simple: find out why core features weren’t landing with customers and rebuild the strategy so value was clear at every touchpoint.

## What I Delivered

I mapped the full customer journey across web, app and email, pulled data on activation and attrition, and analysed how messaging shaped user behaviour. This turned into a set of clear problems: fragmented product narratives, inconsistent value messages, and poor hierarchy of information.

## Impact

Visa adopted the new proposition structure across multiple markets. UX flows became clearer, feature adoption increased, and teams had a consistent playbook for future releases.
