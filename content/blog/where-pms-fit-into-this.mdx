You’re not drowning in dashboards.

You’re curating the signal.

The agent systems:

- surface patterns
- detect anomalies
- summarise behaviour
- identify opportunities

Your job is to:

- decide which signals actually matter
- connect insight to strategy
- prioritise based on impact
- shape what the system watches next

This is where humans still win:

taste, judgment, interpretation, decision making.
