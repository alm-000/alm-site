## 1. Continuous behavioural analysis (Agent-powered)

This is the analytics equivalent of getting your eyesight back.

Agents should run daily or hourly jobs that:

- cluster user behaviour
- highlight unexpected drop offs
- watch for friction points
- identify flows with high hesitation or repeat actions
- surface anomalies early
- summarise micro-patterns humans wouldn’t spot

Most product teams only look at behaviour during quarterly reviews.

This is how you lose.

Behaviour is the heartbeat. Monitor it constantly.

## 2. Automated insights from events

This is where AI is useful instead of gimmicky.

Your event data should feed an agent that:

- produces weekly “what changed” summaries
- flags event definitions that need cleaning
- finds segments behaving unusually
- alerts you when a metric changes beyond a threshold
- surfaces “hidden wins” (features unexpectedly getting traction)

If your analytics system only reports what you manually check, you’re not doing analytics. You’re doing archaeology.

## 3. Agent-assisted funnel mapping

Funnels break constantly.

People stop noticing them because teams assume “that’s just how it is now.”

Have an agent:

- rebuild funnels every day
- expose steps with statistically meaningful changes
- compare funnels across cohorts
- track drop-off reasons based on behavioural patterns
- pair funnel data with support sentiment and usage sessions

This turns a PM into someone who *knows*, not someone who “has a feeling”.

---

## 4. Qualitative analytics at scale

Most companies treat qualitative data like a love letter: they read it once and never look again.

You want agents to:

- summarise every support ticket
- cluster by root cause
- analyse sentiment
- highlight recurring phrases
- tag issues automatically
- map qualitative feedback to specific flows in the product

This gives you a living map of what users are thinking.

Humans can’t process thousands of messages a week, but agents can.

## 5. Real time retention and cohort drift

Retention is the truth. Everything else is decoration.

Agents should track:

- returning users per cohort
- changes in retention curves
- whether behaviour is shifting in good or bad ways
- which actions predict longer retention
- which segments are quietly dying

This keeps the PM focused on the only metric that matters long term:

**Do people come back or not?**

---

## 6. Opportunity detection

Here’s where analytics becomes strategy.

Agents should scan across:

- high performing behaviours
- underused features
- abandoned flows
- correlation patterns
- “hidden champions” that outperform their visibility

This is how you find product bets that are invisible to the naked eye.

---

## 7. Analytics QA

Oh yes, this is a thing. And most companies do it terribly.

Agents should:

- check event firing accuracy
- watch for dropped events
- detect schema drift
- highlight duplicate or conflicting events
- verify experiment tagging
- validate tracking for new features before release

Your analytics is either clean or it is worthless.

There is no middle category.
